This is a demo project which shows what Blurhash is, how it works and how to use it in your projects. 

It also contains image to blurhash converter.

# Stack

* [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) as a framework
* [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
* [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
* Hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

# Scripts

If you want to run this project locally, just clone this repo and use these scripts (there is everything exactly like by Nuxt):

Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

Then you will be able to use `npm run dev` to start a web-server, which will be at localhost:3000 by default and also with hot reloading.

Of course, with `npm run build` you can build project for production, or use `npm run generate` to build static project.

And `npm run preview` starts a preview mode of you built project.
